print(20/4)

# Python in-built classes all starts with small letters which breaks the conventions.

print(1.2 - 1.0) 
# 0.199999999999999
# ðŸ‘† its making use of approximation when storing the floats and hence we have the problem
# to solve this issue we have to make use of the function round.
# its is called 'floating point error'

#
# ðŸ‘† as we can see that in type cast the 1st variable is string and the reason is we can have 
# various number in base 16 or any other string in different format so its very simple to keep the first argument
# as String

# As float have 'floating point errror', python has comeup with the class called Decimal
# so now if we want to change the precision form 28 -> 4 we have do following steps 
# #

getcontext().prec = 4
output = Decimal(1)/ Decimal(3)

# So to avaoid this we have to use Decimal class with correct input
# ðŸ‘‡ so the correct way is

print(Decimal('3.14'))

# Dealing with the money try to use Decimal class
